          Dear LMU, <br />
          In just a short couple weeks a lot has changed. As I am sitting here
          at my desk, with most of my friends packed up and gone, trying to
          write this letter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am
          recognizing that I have been on autopilot for some time now. So many
          of my friends and community have been displaced and my focus has just
          been trying to support and assist with whatever I can. But now, as
          classes have started and we’re all scattered around the world, my
          emotions are catching up to me. I am overwhelmed. I imagine you all
          are too. But, I think it is important to acknowledge what’s in our
          minds. We don’t always need to find a solution, especially when we
          havn’t processed what the fuck just happened. So my goal for this
          letter is to just feel and be. And to feel and be with you all. With
          that, I am going to try to pinpoint some of the major thoughts and
          feelings I have right now. Maybe acknowledging what I am feeling right
          now can help me begin to make sense of the past and move forward to
          the future. And if you want, you can join me on this journey.

          First off… I feel a lot of pressure to write a nice letter that
          identifies everything that I am and you are feeling… but I can’t do
          that. To do so would be a disservice to me and to you because as much
          as we are in this together, there is a lot going on and it’s not up to
          me, nor you, to represent it all. But the pressure to do so is still
          there.

        <ol>
          All of this extra time makes me feel like I should be getting
          everything and more done. I can get ahead in my classes now. I can
          read that book that people have been recommending to me. I can finally
          eat right, hydrate, and prioritize working out.{" "}

          All of that pressure to do everything makes me feel like I can’t do
          anything. There is so much that I want to do, but now, all I feel like
          I can do is sleep… even though my body isn’t tired.{" "}

        <ol>
          I am tired of this whole situation… I have hated working endlessly to
          pack up my friends’ lives into small boxes and then say goodbye (when
          often many don’t even know where or to what they will be going home
          to).{" "}

          All of these emails. I am tired of organizing and trying to advocate
          to the university administration about the needs of all of us students
          and then to only realize that even though intentional policies can and
          are being made, there will still be negative consequences--because
          that is just the nature of what is going on right now.

          Through all of the difficulties I can’t believe how warm my heart
          feels (ok cheesy much??). I have felt so much love towards and from
          students and community members as we try to navigate this situation
          without a clear roadmap.{" "}
        </ol>{" "}
        <ol>
          I appreciate that people have genuinely asked me how I am doing during
          this time. Knowing that people love and care for me has gotten me
          through (and through life in general tbh) and I can only hope to
          reciprocate that love to you all.{" "}

          It has been really hard not knowing what is coming next, but I have
          felt ok getting through because I know that we have the support of one
          and other. I am so grateful to my friends, professors, and advisors
          who have been so accommodating and open to help during this time. It
          means a lot (even if I don’t respond right away).

          It has been pretty friggin cool to see the power of student
          mobilization. Us students at LMU and across the world have come
          together to get our voices heard and fight for what we need during
          this time. Whenever I feel like I am too young or too dumb to do
          something, I will think of these past few weeks and our actions to
          remind myself that we aren’t just capable, we’re pretty good at what
          we do. I am inspired by you all everyday and proud to be a part of the
          work.{" "}

          Niche shoutout but to all of those gyms (specifically the
          @lmusportsperformance) who have been providing free online workouts
          during this time… that has taken away so much of my anxiety. I
          struggle a lot being in one spot for an extended period of time and I
          appreciate the individuals and groups who know that feeling and have
          worked to be there for me and others.{" "}
        </ol>
        <br />
        So those four emotions are just a small portion of what is filling my
        brain and I am not really sure what to do with them. But maybe that is
        ok. I am trying to force myself to be ok with not knowing the answers to
        what is next-- and to also be ok with my friends and acquaintances not
        knowing either. We are all going through something and we might not have
        the strength to get up and solve everything. We have been too tired to
        do so, but through it all, we’ve still managed to be together and that
        is powerful. That will keep us going. Writing this makes me think of
        this anonymous quote: <br />
        <ol>
          “Friends pick us up when we fall down, and if they can’t pick us up,
          they lie down and listen for a while.”
        </ol>{" "}
        <br />
        There is so much going on and we’re all experiencing this differently,
        with different emotions. But those emotions are real and before we can
        get the strength to get up and do, together, let’s acknowledge where we
        are now.
        <br /> So here we are, wherever that may be, just being. I invite you
        all to comment, write, talk, text, zoom, FT, whatever the fuck your
        feeling and take a moment with me to just be.
        <br />{" "}
