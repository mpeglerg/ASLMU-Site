              In times of widespread emergency, LMU administration needs to make
              informed decisions that center student need and voice. As COVID-19
              responses develop, we encourage the university to acknowledge and
              address student concerns about the academic, emotional, and
              physical impacts of the pandemic. Staff and Faculty are actively
              working to ensure student success in this time, but are in many
              senses lacking full context of student need. As ASLMU is an
              imperative link between students and administrative bodies, we
              hope to establish a standard of student involvement in action
              plans and communications moving forward. We believe that students
              must be involved in these preliminary conversations. In order to
              provide adequate support and resources, LMU’s emergency procedures
              need to articulate and actualize student presence. Moving forward,
              we will work to update LMU’s emergency procedures to efficiently
              and effectively collaborate with students in future times of
              crisis. We also strive to keep students informed on immediate
              resources to help us all move forward:

              We believe that we cannot run this campaign without acknowledging

              been instrumental in the process of advocating for social justice
              since long before our time. This campaign is not about any one
              individual but instead about the collective work of the whole
              community of past, present, and future lions to come. With all of
              us together, the dream lives on.

              LMU students, we are undeniably at very high levels of privilege
              that we are called to utilize while advocating for the needs of
              marginalized communities. With that, we must take a step back and
              critically examine our own actions as a university committed to
              social justice. We have found that our actions, though well
              intentioned, can perpetuate a savior complex. We also acknowledge
              that too often people of marginalized communities are forced to
              expend emotional labor, as they are put into a position as
              teachers of social justice issues. Leading in light of the wise

              wise words, “savor the world, don’t save it,” we must take the
              time to unpack, unlearn, and dismantle our practices.
              Specifically, we would like to support and uplift the Justice
              League, so that we can create a space for all social justice
              oriented clubs to come together, build coalition, and work towards
              equity and justice. Currently, we are a part of groups within the
              Justice League, such as{" "}

              be in community with LMU and California students. Here, we learned
              of many ways other schools are accommodating their students and
              staff. This year is LGBTSS’s 10 year anniversary, and we’re
              excited to continue collaborating with LGBTSS and other college
              campuses to improve our home here on the bluff. Our initiatives
              moving forward to support our LGBTQ+ students include creating a
              student and staff task force to implement a research-based
              resource kit to support our trans or transitioning students,
              staff, faculty, and employees expanding the menstrual hygiene
              initiative to be open and accessible to all menstruating bodies,
              and hosting and collaborating with Transcendence to host a Trans

              As students who have both utilized and worked with our Student

              book an appointment can only further anxiety and deter many
              students. We plan to make the process of booking easier and less
              intimidating by working with SPS to create an online booking
              portal and live calendar feed that students can reference for
              scheduling. We also plan to increase transparency about all SPS

              university such as LMU. However, committing to this life and work
              has put many athletes in tough situations. Student athletes battle
              various issues relating to mental and physical health, food and
              housing insecurity, and the overall inability to be themselves in
              an extremely gendered setting. We will initiate, support, and
              encourage our athletics department to address these problems
              holistically. This will include promoting the Student Athlete
              Mental Health Awareness Month, alleviating some financial stress
              by implementing partial or full meal plans for freshmen and
              sophomore student athletes, and collaborating with our Trans

              restrooms on campus. Taylor learned a lot during the year, as she
              primarily focused on promoting awareness on the complex and

              Taylor will secure that LMU supports and pays for increasing the

              cornerstone of a strong community on our campus. With that being

              significant sacrifice of time that should not go unrewarded. With

              network of support outside of our constantly changing ASLMU, so
              that our work and the goals of past, present, and future ASLMUers
              will be fulfilled.

          No student’s success should be hindered by racial bias, mental health,
          gender exclusivity, inaccessibility, or food insecurity. As members of
          the current ASLMU administration, we will use our experiential
          knowledge, privileges, approachability, and intersectional identities
          to center the <span style={{ color: "#f79051" }}>student voice </span>
          and continue making LMU a healthy and exciting place to call home. If
          elected, we will
